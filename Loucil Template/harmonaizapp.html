								<h1>HarmonAIz</h1>

							<p>
								HarmonAIz is a mobile-friendly web application that my team and I built at <b>University of Floridaâ€™s hackathon, SwampHacks</b>. When a representative from Clarifai presented her company's newest image-recognition API that generates tags based on the image received at the opening ceremony... my team and I immediately got to thinking on how an API such as this could be used to impact our everyday lives.
								<br /><br />
								Ten minutes of brainstorming, 2 hours of downloading and switching between multiple Java IDEs and setting up our environment, 5 hours of figuring out the logic behind our app, 12 hours of learning how to implement our program on a Java web app framework called Spark, 1 hour that we felt like giving up, 2 hours of nap (yes, we actually slept), 5 hours of debugging, testing and refining our program, ~2 hours on front end.... and what we got as a result was HarmonAIz.<br /><br />
								<b>Harmonaiz is an app that allows us to live in the moment.</b> By simply uploading an image of your environment, this app will generate a song based on the objects recognized in the image. At the time, we stuck to a short list of songs. When the user uploads a picture of the beach, the app will play One Love by Bob Marley. (Read What's Next? below to learn how we plan on redesigning this...)<br /><br />
								There is one big thing that we really wanted our user to get out of this, as simple of a program as this was... That is, to not waste time digging through a playlist to find the right song that will set the mood. We want our user to enjoy the moment. One click, and we'll set the mood for you.</p>

									<h2 style="letter-spacing:0px;">Project Breakdown</h2>
								</center>
								<h4>Role</h4>
								<p>For this project, I carried on the role of a project manager and full stack developer, working on both the front-end and the back-end of the app.
								</p>
								<br />

								<h4>Challenges We Ran Into</h4><br />
								<p>Our biggest challenges would have to be setting up the environment, figuring out the logic behind our program and understanding how we would use the API in our program. Also, my team members and I only had basic knowledge of Java and we've never used an API before, so it took us a while to figure out how we were storing our data and outputting our data based off the results generated by the API.
								</p>
								<br />
								<h4>Accomplishments We're Proud Of</h4><br />
								<p>
									Even though we did not have enough time to host and further refine our application online, we accompliahed our goal of learning how to develop a Java web app. We got it to work properly, and we were able to submit it, and demo it on our last day at SwampHacks.
								</p>
								<br />
								<h4>What's Next for HarmonAIz?</h4>
								<p>
									The plan is to rewrite the app in Python, using Clarifai's Python API. We feel that using Python would make writing the code much easier and more efficient. Also, we plan to use YouTube or Pandora's API to generate a playlist from the user's image input to automate the tag-song matcthing and to give us the ability to choose a song from a large database of playlists.<br /><br />
									<b>So, check back this summer to see the result of our app revamp :-)</b>
